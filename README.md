# Snowfall Animation in Terminal

This code creates a beautiful snowfall animation in the terminal using simple ASCII characters. It uses a grid-based approach to simulate the falling snow, and the animation is achieved by continuously updating the grid and redrawing it on the screen.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Importing Necessary Modules

```python
import os, random, time
```

We import the necessary modules:

- `os`: This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as clearing the terminal screen.
- `random`: This module provides functions for generating random numbers, which we'll use to create the snowflakes.
- `time`: This module provides functions for controlling the speed of the animation.

### 2. Defining Constants

```python
SNOW_DENSITY = 1
DELAY = 0.3
```

We define two constants:

- `SNOW_DENSITY`: This constant controls the density of the snowflakes. A higher value means more snowflakes, while a lower value means fewer snowflakes.
- `DELAY`: This constant controls the speed of the animation. A higher value means a slower animation, while a lower value means a faster animation.

### 3. Creating the Snowflake Characters

```python
snowflakes = ["❄️", "●", ".", "❆", "❉"]
```

We define a list of snowflake characters. These characters will be randomly selected and displayed in the animation.

### 4. Getting the Terminal Size

```python
terminal = os.get_terminal_size()

w = terminal.columns
h = terminal.lines
```

We get the size of the terminal window in terms of its width (`w`) and height (`h`). This information is used to create the grid that represents the snowfall area.

### 5. Creating the Grid

```python
grid = []

for _ in range(h):
    grid.append([" "]*w)
```

We create a grid to represent the snowfall area. The grid is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the grid. Initially, all cells in the grid are filled with spaces (" ").

### 6. Drawing the Grid

```python
def draw_grid():
    os.system('cls' if(os.name=='nt') else 'clear' )
    print('\033[? 25l')
    output = ''
    for row in grid:
